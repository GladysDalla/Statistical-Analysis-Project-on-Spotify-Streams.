My Questions

1.	Does a song with several featuring artists have a better streaming performance than one with just one artist? 
> The purpose of this question is to investigate if there is a significant difference in the average number of streams for songs featuring multiple artists and those with the single featuring artist. I want to assess whether collaborations with other artists results in higher streaming numbers. This will provide insights into the potential benefits of including featuring artists to a song for its streaming success.

2.	What features of music are associated with the total number of streams on Spotify?
> The purpose of the question is to understand the factors or characteristics of music tracks that influence their popularity and streaming success on the Spotify platform. I want to identify the correlation between the features and the stream numbers.
